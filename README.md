# CheckersFun

A Checkers game built with a clear separation between the game rules,
the AI logic, and the React UI.

The focus of this project is correctness and clean structure rather than
flashy visuals. All standard rules are handled, including forced captures,
king promotion, draw conditions, and blocked positions.

The code is written to be easy to read, test, and extend.
